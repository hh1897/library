# library

A library table with a form to submit new books. Each book must include a title, author, page amount and read status.
There are two edit options available: change read status and delete. 

Languages include: JavaScript, CSS, HTML.

Tools: Visual Studio 2019, GitHub Desktop Version Control.

Reflection: This task improved my knowledge of input types for forms and how to place this data into a table.
